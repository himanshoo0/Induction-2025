At 10 a.m., we reached the auditorium, but the induction program was a bit late.

 After some time, we were warmly welcomed by our seniors and our anchor with  a warm speech. <br>

The anchor showed videos of our aluminies who were placed in companies.
One of them was IT Department topper, Arshpreet Singh. 
He was encouraging us to explore in college; he told us to go all in and explore everything we can.

He also told us to have a balance of everything. 
Have fun in college, but don't forget to brush up on your skills.<br>

Then our HOD of Applied Science, Dr. Harpreet Kaur Grewal, gave a brief speech about our glorious college, about our alumni, and the history of our institution.
